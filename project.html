            <p>The ability to detect cones in the scene is crucial for autonomous driving applications, such as autonomous racing, as it enables the vehicle to navigate through a course safely and efficiently. In the Formula Student driverless competitions, the teams are required to navigate through a series of cones, and detecting the cones accurately can give the team a competitive edge. In this project, we will learn how to use MATLAB® and Simulink® to detect cones in a virtual environment, which can help us gain valuable experience in autonomous driving. In this project, we will use the Generate Skidpad Test model introduced in R2023a in the Vehicle Dynamics Blockset™. The skidpad model includes a reference path, driver, vehicle, and visualization aides. The vehicle’s dynamics response can be visualized using photorealistic 3D scenes created with Unreal Engine in the Simulation 3D Viewer.</p>
